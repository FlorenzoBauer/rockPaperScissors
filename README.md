### Context
As mod1 students in the Turing program (week 5/6 of the program), I worked on this project as a solo project over the time period of a week (Monday-Sunday). I utilized HTML, ES5 JavaScript, and CSS to build the project. I leveraged tools and resources such as MDN, Google, and previous experience to work through each problem.

### Wins and Challenges
The biggest challenge was using constructors, and methods and the behaviour with the DOM. It was something not used before, or something I have had experience with before, and learning something new, while implementing it with something I've done was a great accomplishment and a great struggle. I overcame it with my resources, and help of mentors, while overall using my problem solving skills, and my own persistance to learn something new, and meld it together with some things old.
